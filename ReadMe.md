# Arduino RFID Cloner

To ensure proper functioning of the code, you need to install the following libraries:

-   MFRC522
-   Wire
-   Adafruit_GFX
-   Adafruit_SSD1306

## About the Project

This project allows you to clone RFID tags and cards operating at a frequency of 13.56 MHz.

## How to Copy Data:

To duplicate data from one card to another, follow these steps:

1. Begin by reading the card from which you want to copy data.
2. Flip the switch connected to `A0`.
3. Now, place the second card.

## Required Components:

-   1 Arduino (preferably Nano)
-   1 MFRC522
-   3 LEDs
-   5 resistors 3x 330 Î© (for LEDs), 2x 10000 Î© (for switches)
-   2 switches
-   1 OLED display ssd136
-   13.56MHz RFID cards/keychains with write capability
-   Power source

Please make sure to wire the components as specified in the project documentation for proper functionality.
